# UCSC-Natural-Language-Processing
## labs from UCSC AISV_801 Natural Language Processing ##

**AISV_801_lab1_Wen**  - Load the iris dataset from sklearn, analyze data, load into a datagrom and apply data pre-Processing.

**AISV_801_lab2_Wen** - Load the imdb dataset from Hugging Face, create functions to explore, tokenize, clean, and vectorize data.

**AISV_801_lab3_Wen** - Load Rotten Tomates data set from Scilearn, load, split into train and test dataset, perform a grid search on the data models, print out the Inference and classification reports and interpret the model data.
 
 **AISV_801_lab4_Wen** - Explore Word2vec using poem_sentiment dataset.  Explore choosing a word, find the n most similar words.  Code the famous king - man = queen.  
    Create a function to calculate the average word2vec of a given string

**AISV_801_lab5_Wen** - Train a BERT model to perform text classification on the imdb dataset

**AISV_801_lab6_Wen** - Load GPT2 from Hugging Face, use it to generate text for prompts of your choice!  Find one more recent large language model, use it to generate text for prompts of your choice!

**AISV_801_lab7_Wen** - Fine tune an LLM on a custom dataset.  Start witht lamini (https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI/LaMini-Cerebras-590M) and train with guanaco dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco)

**AISV_801_lab8_Wen** - Fine tune an LLM on a custom using dataset Helper scripts and QLoRa.

**AISV_801_fnlPrjct_Wen** - Nature Language Processing of medical chatbots in healthcare.  This project takes a medical LLM and train it with new medical data to refine a healthcare chatbot.
